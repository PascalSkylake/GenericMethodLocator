# GenericMethodLocator
Some stupidly bad code for finding chunks with best clustering

- input the CSV result of /loadedChunks dump taken while standing in glass chunk
- input chunk coords of glass chunk
- get top (3 by default) chunks to do generic method, third number in each chunk is the amount of clustering, higher is better

currently only works for render distance 12
